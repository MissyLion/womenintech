                <h4>Siobhan did a sports science degree back in Ireland, comprising science, maths,  physics, biomechanics, chemistry and biology/physiology. Once she finished, she discovered there was not a great deal of opportunity for finding work. She went back to an organisation she’d worked with previously and it was identified that she was good at maths so could join the testing team. This involved taking business requirements and figuring out what the system should do based on requirements. She made test cases and then tested on the software that was being rolled out. She worked for 5-6 years in Ireland, then came to New Zealand (to watch rugby!) and never left. The analysis is the important thing for her. If you have the problem solving skills, these are very transferable. So you can pick up work across a range of places. Everything changes in tech; there’s no standing still, so there’s always work (and it’s decently paid in comparison to a lot of other roles). Working in tech, she also finds there is often the ability to have flexible working conditions so that it fits in with other stuff that you’ve got going on in life. Testing itself can be very broad; it can be technical or it can involved interacting with the system in the way a user would, to see what the user will see.
