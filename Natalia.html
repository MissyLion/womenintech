                <p>Natalia’s background is not technical at all. She studied sports psychology at university in England where you can only do one subject for a degree (i.e., there are no double majors). Therefore, she says, you study the same thing for three years. Natalia aspired to work with professional athletes; she wanted to work with people and help people. She completed her  masters and then decided she needed a break from academia … and took up snowboarding! She moved to France and lived there, snowboarding at the centre of everything. Then she came to New Zealand so she could have back to back winters and not have to stop snowboarding. At this time, she lived in Queenstown. Then she and her partner decided to move to New Zealand permanently. She got a job in administration in Wellington, working within a project space alongside managers and technical people. From there she moved into different roles: project co-ordinator, project manager. Natalia moved to Kiwibank as a project manager, working in technology but in the business area (there are separate business and tech people). She was a business project manager. Then followed the move to Kiwi Wealth as a delivery manager in the retail space. This meant Natalia could work with all the technology people. Here she used the agile framework/methodology which has become so popular. She went on courses and learnt about that side of things. When Kiwi Wealth got a new Chief Technology Officer, Natalia made it known that she wanted to be in technology. She moved into a role that was vacated - a people lead who managed the  team on a daily basis. She was still able to come in and manage the team without a technical background. This was helped by always having an interest in technology. Having an interest/passion and being ambitious has allowed her to get where she is today.

                Natalia has learnt a lot about people; how to interact with people; how to care for people. She says “tools and technologies can be learnt but interacting with people and analysis/problem solving/listening to people - that is all super important in today’s work environment.” Women are EXTRA good at soft skills.
