                <p>Ashton went to St Oran’s! When she left, she played in a band touring the country for a year. Then at university she studied maths, economics and physics as a science degree with a double major in economics and maths, doing physics “for fun”. When she finished, she went and worked with a friend from St Oran’s who’d started as a junior analyst at EQC. She started as a junior analyst just after the big earthquakes when, as you can imagine, there was a lot going on. A supervisor at her work showed her how to code SQL and because she had a logical/analytical background it worked out that she would move into an area of data analysis using this skill. Ashton says “you need to enjoy problem solving.” All the while, she was gaining more experience in different roles. She took every available chance to learn a new skill or technology. You are always learning with technology. If you enjoy a moving environment, tech is good because you have to constantly learn.</p>
