                The idea from this website arose when Wellington digital technologies teachers were offered an opportunity to go into information technology (IT) workplaces to see the potential career pathways for their students in action. Our teacher visited Kiwi Wealth and there she met Linda McCarthy, Systems Architect, who features in some of our student websites. Linda spoke of the relative scarcity of women in the IT
                industry and the idea of profiling women who work at Kiwi Wealth in the IT area. Our digital technologies class took a trip into Wellington and met the women who feature on this website and our project this term has been to profile them and the different roles they carry out.

                Different pathways
                A flick through this website will underscore the many different pathways that women have followed to come into the IT industry.

                Soft skills
                Many of the women who spoke about their jobs mentioned that women do so well in this industry because of their strength in the “soft skills”. These  are things like interacting with people and organisational abilities. Natalia says:
                “I’ve learnt a lot about people; how to interact with people; how to care for people. Tools and technologies can be learnt but interacting with people and analysis/problem solving/listening to people - that is all super important in today’s work environment.”

                We were told that people advertise for technical skills, but it’s the soft skills that make a difference when interviewing. The question interviewers have in the back of their mind is: “Will this person be a good fit for our team?”

                When asked about sexism/bias in the workplace, we were told that there might be occasional unconscious bias but individual personalities can overcome this. Having men earn more for doing the same job has made these women very aware of their own worth. Some took some time to learn to stand up for themselves but have developed strong self-belief.

                Problem solving skills are very transferable.
                That growth mindset is huge you are always learning
